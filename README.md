## Introduction

This repository is created for Machine Learning Assignment as part of the 2018/19 Machine Learning module CS7CS4 at Trinity College Dublin.

### Getting Started

You can learn how to analyze the impact of noise on dataset for machine learning application.

### DataSet

The dataset consists of data collected from heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage. The system in focus is the Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurised air that are utilized in various functions in a truck, such as braking and gear changes. The datasets' 
positive class consists of component failures for a specific component of the APS system. The negative class consists of trucks with failures for components not related to the APS. The data consists of a subset of all available data, selected by experts.

```
After November 2018, the repository is open for the contribution.
### 
In phase 2 we have done done the analysis of Noise on Performance of Machine LearningAlgorithms

### DataSet for this phase 

We have used a famous multiclass Wine Quality Data-Set from UCI Machine Learning library which consisted of the red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine\cite{uci}. In this project, we have used only white wine dataset with 4898 instances. The data contains no missing values and consists of only numeric data. The data-set has 12 attributes and 'Quality' being the target variable which indicates the wine quality on scale of 0-10.
